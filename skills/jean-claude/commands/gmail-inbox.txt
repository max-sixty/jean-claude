Usage: jean-claude gmail inbox [OPTIONS]

  List threads in inbox.

  Returns threads (conversations) matching Gmail UI behavior. A thread shows
  as unread if ANY message in it is unread.

  Note: Gmail has a known bug where previously-snoozed threads may appear in
  --unread results even after being read. The snooze state isn't exposed via
  the API, so we can't filter these client-side. See:
  https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/151714665

Options:
  -n, --max-results INTEGER  Maximum results
  --unread                   Only show unread threads
  --page-token TEXT          Token for next page of results
  --help                     Show this message and exit.
